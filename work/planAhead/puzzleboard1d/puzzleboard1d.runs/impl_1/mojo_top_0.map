ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      6
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         6

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       172 out of   2,860    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       11,183
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        10,965 out of  11,183   98%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  40 out of  11,183    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         178 out of  11,183    1%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              50 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
